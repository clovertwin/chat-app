# SayHey

## Project Overview

This is a realtime chat application built around Socket.io. The backend uses Node.js and Express,
and the frontend is built with React, Vite, and Typescript.

NOTE: The backend is deployed to a free Render web service, and on first entering chat may take a few
seconds to receive a welcome message.

## Login

To login use any name you want, and enter any name you want for the room. If someone else joins a room with
the same name communication will be possible.

## Live Demo
